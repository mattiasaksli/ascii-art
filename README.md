# ascii-art
Simple image to ASCII art converter for Windows. Does not support gifs (for now).

---

## Usage
Unzip the .zip folder from the releases and put your desired image in the same directory as the .exe file. Then open the .exe file, which will prompt you to input the image filename and optionally resize the image to be smaller. Both of these can be entered as command line argments as well.

Enjoy!
